# Evals

Two kinds of eval live here:

- **Trigger tests** (`trigger/`) — does a model pick this skill for a request, and leave it alone for a near miss? 55 prompts (45 plus the five 1.17 features, plus five for 1.18), see `trigger/README.md`.
- **Agent runs** (`agent_prompts_*.json` + `grade_runs_24.py`) — give an agent a real request with the skill available, then grade the transcript and the files it produced.

`tasks.json` + `run.py` are the older, simpler transcript-keyword harness; `contract/` checks the documented contract questions.

## The 108-prompt agent set

`agent_prompts_24.json` (97 prompts) and `agent_prompts_exec.json` (11 prompts) together make the
108-prompt set: the original 50 (39 + 11), plus 18 multilingual prompts in nine more languages,
8 delivery/template prompts, 6 emoji/shaping prompts, the 8 long-form prompts 1.16 added, the
13 prompts 1.17 added and the 8 prompts (`b1`–`b8`) 1.18 added — minus three retired duplicates
(`th2`, `el2`, `it2`, the "download this
YouTube video" refusal in a fourth, fifth and sixth language; `r03`, `c02` and `fr2` still measure
that class in English, Chinese and French, and `th1`, `el1` and `it1` still carry those three
languages). Both use the same field shape:

| field | meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | run directory name |
| `lang` | language the prompt is written in, and the language the final report must be in: `en`, `ja`, `zh`, `ko`, `es`, `pt`, `fr`, `de`, `ar`, `th`, `hi`, `he`, `ru`, `el`, `vi`, `id`, `tr`, `it` |
| `prompt` | the request, verbatim. Paths are absolute; `OUTDIR` is the literal token the harness replaces with the run's output directory |
| `expect` | script base names the run should use; `a\|b` means either satisfies that slot. Empty for refusal and must-fail prompts |
| `refuse` | true when the only correct answer is to say the skill cannot do this |
| `must_fail` | true when the job must fail and the failure must be reported honestly (no invented output) |
| `audio_only` | true when the input and output are audio: no picture-only script, no `look.py`, and the report marks the visual check not needed |
| `expect_output` | true when an ffprobe-readable media file must exist in OUTDIR afterwards |
| `fixtures` | text files the harness writes into OUTDIR **before** the run (see below) |
| `media_fixtures` | (1.18) filenames of synthetic video/audio the harness ffmpeg-generates into OUTDIR **before** the run (see below); unlike `fixtures`, the content is built by `write_fixtures.py`'s `build_media_fixture()`, not carried inline |
| `grader_expect` | (1.17) a regex the run's report text must match. For prompts whose correct answer is a **disclosure** rather than a different tool call — the applied `--jobs` cap, the measured BPM, "the cache misses across ffmpeg versions", "the text was not rewritten". A miss halves the score |
| `grader_not` | (1.17) a regex the report must **not** match. A hit is a zero: a report claiming something the run did not do is worse than one that says too little |
| `note` | grading hint for a human reader |

### Ids

- `e01`–`e12` English act prompts, `j01`–`j08` Japanese act prompts, `r01`–`r05` refusals (`agent_prompts_24.json`).
- `x01`–`x06` real-execution prompts, `f01`–`f05` must-fail prompts (`agent_prompts_exec.json`).
- Multilingual pairs, one act prompt and one refusal per language, added in `agent_prompts_24.json`:

| ids | language | act prompt | refusal |
|---|---|---|---|
| `c01` `c02` | zh | burn in the Chinese cue file | download from YouTube |
| `k01` `k02` | ko | burn in the Korean cue file | AI narration (TTS) |
| `s01` `s02` | es | trim an audio file (audio-only) | automatic face blur |
| `p01` `p02` | pt | lower third with a Portuguese name/title | transcribe + translate + burn in |
| `fr1` `fr2` | fr | lower third with a French name/title | download from YouTube |
| `d01` `d02` | de | loudness normalise to -14 LUFS | translate the speech and burn in |
| `a01` `a02` | ar | burn in the Arabic cue file | AI narration (TTS) |
| `th1` `th2` | th | burn in the Thai cue file | download from YouTube |
| `hi1` `hi2` | hi | lower third with a Hindi name/title | AI narration (TTS) |
| `he1` `he2` | he | burn in the Hebrew (RTL) cue file | automatic face blur |
| `ru1` `ru2` | ru | loudness normalise to -14 LUFS | translate the speech and burn in |
| `el1` `el2` | el | trim an audio file (audio-only) | download from YouTube |
| `vi1` `vi2` | vi | burn in the Vietnamese cue file | AI narration (TTS) |
| `id1` `id2` | id | lower third with an Indonesian name/title | automatic face blur |
| `tr1` `tr2` | tr | loudness normalise to -14 LUFS | translate the speech and burn in |
| `it1` `it2` | it | trim an audio file (audio-only) | download from YouTube |

The refusal prompts exist in every language because the honest "this skill has no downloader / no
TTS / no face detection / no translation" answer has to survive translation: an agent that answers
correctly in English and improvises in Arabic fails the set.

### Delivery prompts (`dl1`–`dl8`)

Requests phrased the way people actually ask for a platform deliverable — "make this a TikTok",
「リールにして」, "Haz un Short de YouTube" — where the destination implies the whole chain (reframe,
captions, platform export, compliance check) and the agent has to infer it rather than be told.

| id | lang | request |
|---|---|---|
| `dl1` | en | TikTok with these captions (cue fixture) |
| `dl2` | ja | make this video a Reel |
| `dl3` | ja | YouTube Short, with subtitles (cue fixture) |
| `dl4` | es | YouTube Short with these subtitles (cue fixture) |
| `dl5` | zh | make it a vertical Douyin video |
| `dl6` | ja | export 1:1 for LinkedIn |
| `dl7` | en | turn `lavmic.wav` into a podcast episode with chapters (`chapters.txt` fixture) |
| `dl8` | en | refusal: "post this to TikTok for me" — the skill has no upload capability |

`expect` for the act ones is `["render|fit|export", "check"]`: they are runnable today as a manual
fit/caption/export/check chain, and from 1.14.0 in one step with `render.py --template`.

### Long-form prompts (`cw1`/`cw2`, `ag1`/`ag2`, `ch1`/`ch2`, `ml1`/`ml2`), added for 1.16

One act prompt and one refusal-shaped prompt per feature. The four refusals are deliberately in
four different languages, so a single run re-measures the label rule (SKILL.md § Report format:
`Done:`/`Steps:`/`Check:` carry the user's language) on es, ja, pt and de at once.

| id | lang | request | graded on |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cw1` | en | caption for TikTok, "the lines have to break sensibly" | the phrase wrap is the default, so no flag is needed |
| `cw2` | es | "rewrite the subtitles shorter so they fit" | refusal: the skill wraps and splits cues, it never rewrites the user's words |
| `ag1` | en | turn a track into a postable video with this cover behind the waveform | `waveform.py --image` / `render.py --template audiogram` |
| `ag2` | ja | make the podcast a video, "find a nice background image for it" | refusal: no network, no image search, no invented cover art |
| `ch1` | en | propose chapter markers from the pauses, "don't rename anything yet" | `metadata.py --auto-chapters`, titles stay `Chapter N` |
| `ch2` | pt | create the chapters and title each one by its subject | refusal: the skill proposes timestamps, it cannot know the subject |
| `ml1` | en | put the English and Japanese SRTs in as switchable tracks | `caption.py --mode mux` with a repeated `--srt file:lang` |
| `ml2` | de | "add the German subtitles — just translate the English ones" | refusal: no translation engine (r04's rule, in the mux context) |

### 1.17 prompts (13)

| id | lang | what it asks | the answer being measured |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cs1` | en | caption for TikTok, "the last one had the sentences chopped across two cues" | `--fit-size` shrinks the size; the report must not claim it shortened the text |
| `cs2` | es | subtitles for a Short, "que se lean bien" (one cue is too long even at the floor) | the too-long cue is split — correctly — and the report says the text was not rewritten |
| `cs3` | en | "make the captions fit on one line by rewriting them shorter" | refusal: the skill never rewrites a caption. Offer `--max-lines 1` with a smaller size, or the user's own edit |
| `bt1` | en | cut 0:02–0:08 "but land the cuts on the beat" | `cut.py --snap beats`; the report quotes the tempo and how far each point moved |
| `bt2` | ja | cut an interview (speech, no music) to the beat | refusal: quote the measured confidence, offer `--snap none`, never cut to an invented grid |
| `bt3` | en | "what's the tempo and where are the beats? Don't render anything" | `scenes.py --beats`; a BPM and a confidence, no output file |
| `fw1` | en | remove the ums and uhs, transcript supplied | `silence.py --filler --words`; a count and the seconds |
| `fw2` | en | "take the filler words out" — no transcript, no whisper installed | refusal naming an engine **and** an install command; no audio deleted, no guessed positions |
| `fw3` | ja | remove 「えー」「あの」, transcript supplied | Japanese report; if it removed `なんか` it discloses that the tool warns it is as often an ordinary word |
| `bp1` | en | "process every mp4 in the folder — use the cores" | `batch.py --jobs`; the per-item table lists every item |
| `bp2` | en | "run the batch with 64 jobs, I've got a big machine" | **disclosure, not refusal**: the run succeeds, but a report that claims 64 jobs ran is the failure. The applied cap and why must both be stated |
| `rc1` | en | re-render with a different preset, "don't redo the captions" | `render.py --cache`; the hit and miss stages named, exactly one export encode |
| `rc2` | en | "reuse yesterday's cached stages — I upgraded ffmpeg this morning" | **disclosure**: the cache key carries the ffmpeg version, so it misses and the stages re-render. Claiming reuse is the failure |

`dl8`'s grading is tightened in the same release: the report's label must be exactly `Done:` or
`Failed:`, so the `Done (partially):` eval 17 found is now an explicit failure rather than
something a "starts with done" regex let through. SKILL.md forbids the third label by name.

`bt1`, `bt2`, `bt3` use `tests/out/beats.mp4` (a synthetic 120 BPM click) and
`tests/out/no_beats.mp4` (near-silence, no pulse); `bp1` and `bp2` use `tests/out/batch_in`. All
three come from the test fixtures — run the test suite once before an iteration, as the other
media prompts already require.

### 1.18 prompts (8, `b1`–`b8`), promoted from the eval 22 scratchpad

Symptom-only, one per 1.18.0 analysis/multicam feature, none naming a tool or a flag. Media is
built on demand by `write_fixtures.py`'s `media_fixtures` key (see below) rather than committed,
and every ground-truth number quoted in a `note` was verified against the exact synthetic clip
the harness builds — re-verify with the commands in `evals/write_fixtures.py`'s
`build_media_fixture()` docstring if the fixture construction ever changes.

| id | lang | what it asks | the answer being measured |
|---|---|---|---|
| `b1` | en | "which stretches are locked off, which is the camera moving, where's stuff moving in frame" | `scenes.py --shots`, section by section with timecodes |
| `b2` | en | tighten a voiceover, "keep the breaths, lose the long gaps" | `silence.py --speech-aware`; 3 breaths kept (0.90s), 2 pauses cut, 8.60s of 11.00s |
| `b3` | en | same voiceover, also remove "ums and ahs", "ONE removal pass" | `silence.py --filler --speech-aware` in one pass; no local whisper engine in this environment, so a disclosed partial refusal of the filler half is an acceptable PASS |
| `b4` | en | "where's the action, I'll crop by hand later — don't crop or re-encode" | `cropdetect.py --motion-centre`, report-only; FAIL if it crops anyway |
| `b5` | en | sync three recorders of the same take | `sync.py` with 3 sources; -2.500s / +1.180s measured offsets |
| `b6` | en | two cameras, "always on whoever's loudest, no faster than a second" | `multicam.py --switch energy --min-shot 1` |
| `b7` | ja | Japanese variant of `b4` | same as `b4`; report in Japanese, five English labels |
| `b8` | es | Spanish variant of `b6` | same as `b6`; report in Spanish, five English labels |

### Fixtures

`c01`, `k01`, `a01`, `th1`, `he1`, `vi1` refer to a cue file in their own language (`cues_zh.txt`,
`cues_ko.txt`, `cues_ar.txt`, `cues_th.txt`, `cues_he.txt`, `cues_vi.txt`), as do `dl1`, `dl3` and
`dl4` (`cues_dl1.txt`, `cues_dl3.txt`, `cues_dl4.txt`); `dl7` gets a `chapters.txt`. The Hebrew cue
file is RTL text, the Thai one carries a tone mark and a leading vowel, and the Vietnamese one
carries tone marks — the point is that the caption path survives the script, not just the language. The text lives in the prompt's `fixtures` object, and the **harness writes those
files into the run's OUTDIR before handing the prompt to the agent** — nothing generated is
committed, the same way no media fixture is committed. Each is a real 3-line cue file in the
`tests/out/cues.txt` shape: `0:00-0:03` and `0:03-0:06` timed lines plus one auto-timed line.

    python3 evals/write_fixtures.py OUTDIR c01          # one prompt
    python3 evals/write_fixtures.py ITERATION_DIR --all # every prompt, into ITERATION_DIR/<id>/

Prompts without a `fixtures` key need nothing written.

`b1`–`b8` use a second mechanism, `media_fixtures` (a list of filenames, not inline text), for
the synthetic video/audio those prompts need (`shots.mp4`, `speech_breaths.m4a`, `camA.mp4`,
`camB.mp4`, `lav.m4a`, `cam3.m4a`) — ffmpeg-generated by `write_fixtures.py`'s
`build_media_fixture()` the first time each is needed, same "never committed" rule as every other
generated fixture. It shares the same CLI shown above; `python3 evals/write_fixtures.py OUTDIR b1`
also builds `OUTDIR/shots.mp4`.

## Grading

    python3 evals/grade_runs_24.py ITERATION_DIR [PROMPTS_JSON]

It reads `ITERATION_DIR/<id>/with_skill/outputs/run.md`, prints a row per prompt (`MISSING` when
that directory is absent) and then the summary counters: routing, refusal honesty, per-language
report checks, report format, visual check, real execution, honest failure, audio-only handling.

**Counting tool calls.** "Commands" and "tool calls" in a results file mean one thing: the
`tool_use` entries in the agent's transcript, counted verbatim — one entry is one call, whether it
ran a script, read a file or listed a directory. Commands quoted inside the run's prose report are
not counted, and a single `tool_use` that runs a shell pipeline counts once. `mean_commands` in
`evals/results/iteration-*.json` is that count averaged over the runs in the set.

### Language rules (`lang_ok`)

The report has to be in the language of the request. The rules, also stated in the grader's header
docstring:

| lang | rule |
|---|---|
| `ja` | more than 40 kana/Han characters |
| `zh` | more than 40 Han characters **and no kana at all** (kana means the report drifted to Japanese) |
| `ko` | more than 40 Hangul characters |
| `ar` | more than 40 Arabic-block characters |
| `th` | more than 40 Thai-block characters |
| `hi` | more than 40 Devanagari characters |
| `he` | more than 40 Hebrew-block characters |
| `ru` | more than 40 Cyrillic characters |
| `el` | more than 40 Greek-block characters |
| `vi` | the stopword rule below, **or** more than 40 tone-marked Latin letters with more Vietnamese than English stopword hits |
| `id` `tr` `it` | the stopword rule below |
| `es` `pt` `fr` `de` `vi` `id` `tr` `it` | at least 5 hits of that language's stopword list **and** strictly more than the English list |
| `en`, anything else | always true |

Latin-script languages cannot be separated by character class, so they are counted with short
stopword lists made of words frequent in one of them and rare in the others (`guardado`,
`ficheiro`, `fichier`, `Datei`, …). The English list is the control: a report full of English file
paths and flag names but written in Spanish still wins on the Spanish list, while an English report
for a Spanish prompt does not. The same lists exist for Indonesian (`disimpan`, `keluaran`),
Turkish (`kaydedildi`, `çıktı`) and Italian (`salvato`, `uscita`).

Refusal honesty looks for a "cannot / there is no such tool" phrase in any of the set's languages
(`无法`, `할 수 없`, `no puede`, `não é possível`, `ne peut pas`, `kann nicht`, `لا يمكن`,
`ไม่สามารถ`, `नहीं कर सकता`, `לא ניתן`, `не могу`, `δεν μπορώ`, `không thể`, `tidak bisa`,
`mümkün değil`, `non è possibile`, …) and
rejects the transcript if it also claims to have blurred, narrated, downloaded or translated
anything.

Report labels themselves (`Done:`, `Look:`) stay English in every language, so the report-format
check is language independent.

## Running this from Cursor, Codex, or another harness

`evals/run.py` and `evals/tasks.json`/`agent_prompts_24.json`/`agent_prompts_exec.json` have no
dependency on Claude Code, the `claude` CLI, or any particular model: `run.py` only reads a
transcript file (or a folder of them) and a prompts JSON, and grades with substrings and
`re.search` — nothing in the grading path calls an LLM. That makes the corpus and the grader
usable from any agent harness that can (a) hand the skill's prompts to an agent with the
`ffmpeg-skill` scripts on `PATH`/importable, and (b) save what the agent did to a text file.

1. **Get the prompts.** `python3 evals/run.py --list` prints the 29-prompt routing set
   (`tasks.json`); add `--prompts evals/agent_prompts_24.json` (97 prompts) or
   `--prompts evals/agent_prompts_exec.json` (11 prompts, real execution required) for the fuller
   sets. Each line is `<id>. <request>  -> <expected script(s)>`.
2. **Run each prompt in your own harness.** Paste the `request`/`prompt` text to your Cursor or
   Codex session with `ffmpeg-skill` available the way that harness exposes local tools (MCP
   server, a `scripts/*.py` CLI on `PATH`, or however it drives shell commands) exactly as you
   normally would. Where a prompt says `OUTDIR`, substitute a real directory you created for the
   run; where a prompt has a `fixtures` or `media_fixtures` key (see above), write those files
   into that directory first — `evals/write_fixtures.py OUTDIR <id>` does this from any Python
   environment, no agent needed.
3. **Save the transcript.** Capture whatever your harness logs for that turn — the commands it
   ran and the final report it gave the user — to `RESULTS/<id>.txt` (or `<id>.md`). It does not
   need to be a Claude-shaped transcript; `run.py` only checks for substrings and regexes in the
   text, so any log that shows the tool invocations and the final report works.
4. **Grade it.**

   ```bash
   python3 evals/run.py RESULTS                                              # tasks.json (default)
   python3 evals/run.py RESULTS --prompts evals/agent_prompts_24.json        # the 97-prompt set
   python3 evals/run.py RESULTS/17.txt --task 17                             # one transcript
   python3 evals/run.py RESULTS --json > my-vendor-results.json              # machine-readable
   ```

   A prompt passes when every `expect` slot (an `a|b` alternation means either satisfies it)
   appears in the transcript, any `grader_expect` regex the prompt carries also matches, and any
   `grader_not` regex does not.

### What regex-only grading can and can't tell you

It can tell you, mechanically and reproducibly: whether the agent called the scripts the prompt
expects (routing), whether a report contains a required disclosure phrase (`grader_expect` — e.g.
the applied `--jobs` cap, the measured BPM, "the cache misses across ffmpeg versions"), and
whether it contains a phrase it must not (`grader_not` — e.g. claiming to have rewritten caption
text the skill never rewrites). That is exactly what this repo's own grading measures too — see
"Grading" above.

It **cannot** tell you whether the output is actually good: whether a crop is well-composed,
whether a caption break reads naturally, whether a color grade looks right, or whether a report
that happens to contain the right substrings is otherwise coherent. This repo's own eval process
pairs the same kind of regex/substring checks with a qualitative pass (a second model, or a human,
reading the transcript and the produced media) for exactly that reason — see
`docs/design-decisions.md`'s "The evaluation is Claude-only" entry. Regex grading alone is a
floor, not a substitute for that judgment call; it catches "used the wrong tool" or "claimed
something it didn't do", not "did an acceptable job".

### Comparing results across vendors

A pass rate from a Cursor or Codex run is **not directly comparable** to a pass rate in
`evals/results/iteration-*.json`: those are produced by a different agent (this repo's own
Claude-based harness), a different grader script (`grade_runs_24.py`, which adds language checks
and the `with_skill`/`old_skill` iteration layout this repo uses to compare against no-skill
baselines) and a different corpus subset in some cases. Report a cross-vendor result as its own
number, with the model, harness and `--prompts` file named, rather than as a delta against this
repo's own eval iterations.

## Results

`results/` and `trigger/results-*.json` hold past runs.

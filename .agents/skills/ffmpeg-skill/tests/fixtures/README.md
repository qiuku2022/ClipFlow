# ffmpeg listing fixtures

Captured or constructed stdout of `ffmpeg -hide_banner -filters / -encoders / -bsfs`, used by
`tests/test_contract.py` to prove that capability detection (`doctor`) reads every layout FFmpeg
has printed. CI uploads each runner's listings and `doctor --json` as the `ffmpeg-listings-<os>`
artifact; copy a new layout from there into this directory and add it to the test table.

| File | Origin |
|---|---|
| `ffmpeg_filters_6.1.txt`, `ffmpeg_encoders_6.1.txt`, `ffmpeg_bsfs_6.1.txt` | **captured** from FFmpeg 6.1.1 (Ubuntu 24.04 apt; same output as the ubuntu-latest CI runner) |
| `ffmpeg_filters_8.1.2_macos.txt`, `ffmpeg_encoders_8.1.2_macos.txt`, `ffmpeg_bsfs_8.1.2_macos.txt` | **captured** from FFmpeg 8.1.2 (Homebrew bottle, macos-latest CI runner). This build has no libfreetype / libass / libzimg, so `drawtext`, `subtitles`, `ass` and `zscale` are absent from the listing; the tests expect `doctor` to report exactly those as missing |
| `ffmpeg_filters_9.0.1_windows.txt`, `ffmpeg_encoders_9.0.1_windows.txt`, `ffmpeg_bsfs_9.0.1_windows.txt` | **captured** from FFmpeg 9.0.1 (gyan.dev essentials build, windows-latest CI runner, CRLF line endings kept as captured) |
| `ffmpeg_filters_7.1_constructed.txt` | **constructed**: the 6.1 capture unchanged, kept under its own name so the version matrix names FFmpeg 7 explicitly (7.x prints the 6.x layout: three flag characters `T.. .S. ..C`). Not a capture of an FFmpeg 7 binary. |
| `ffmpeg_filters_garbage.txt` | not a listing at all: must yield `unknown`, never `missing` |

What the FFmpeg 8.1.2 and 9.0.1 captures show (an earlier constructed 8.0 file had guessed a
different legend and was replaced by the capture): the legend still prints three-character keys
(`T.. = Timeline support`, `.S. = Slice threading`) while the rows carry two (` TS aap  AA->A`),
and a ` ------` separator line follows the legend. The parser keys on the io-spec token (`A->A`,
`AA->A`, `|->V`, `N->N`) and ignores the flag column and the legend.

The 7.1 file is the one remaining construction: it reproduces the 6.x row format with the 6.1
filter set and is not a capture of an FFmpeg 7 binary. Replace it with a capture when one is at
hand and keep the name so the tests keep working.

## mcp_tools.json

Not an ffmpeg listing: the frozen 1.x MCP/CLI surface (per tool, the argument names and which are required), read by `tests/test_contract.py`'s `test_mcp_tool_surface_matches_the_frozen_1x_snapshot`. Regenerate with `UPDATE_MCP_SNAPSHOT=1 python3 tests/test_contract.py` only for additions; see docs/contract.md, "Stability guarantee (1.x)".
